# Deployment Trigger

This file is used to trigger Vercel deployments when automatic deployments are not working.

Last trigger: 2025-01-31 20:05:00 UTC

## Vercel Configuration Issues to Check:

1. **Branch Configuration**: Make sure Vercel is watching the `master` branch (not `main`)
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/[your-username]/ai-financial-planner/settings/git
   - Check "Production Branch" is set to `master`

2. **GitHub Integration**: 
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/[your-username]/ai-financial-planner/settings/git
   - Ensure GitHub integration is connected
   - If disconnected, reconnect your GitHub repository

3. **Deployment Hooks**:
   - Check if deployments are paused
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/[your-username]/ai-financial-planner/settings
   - Look for "Pause Deployments" and ensure it's OFF

4. **Manual Deployment Command**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```
