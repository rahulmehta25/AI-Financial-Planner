Vercel should auto-deploy from the GitHub push. The deployment includes:

- Real portfolio tracking

## Testing Steps

### 1. Local Testing (Recommended First)
Visit: http://localhost:5173

1. **Test Page**: Go to `/supabase-test`
   - Click "Test Market Data API" - Should show AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL prices
   - Sign up with a test email
   - Sign in to test auth

2. **Portfolio Page**: Go to `/portfolio`
   - Should show empty portfolio for new users
   - Click "Add Holding" button
   - Enter a symbol (e.g., AAPL)
   - Click search icon to verify
   - Add shares and cost basis
   - Submit to see real portfolio value

3. **Login/Register**: Go to `/login` or `/register`
   - Create a new account with Supabase
   - Email confirmation may be required (check spam)

### 2. Production Testing (After Vercel Deploys)
Visit: Your Vercel URL

Same steps as above, but on production.

3. Click "Add Holding"
4. Try these symbols:

## Troubleshooting

### "Symbol not found"
- Make sure you're using valid ticker symbols
- Try major stocks like AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN

### Portfolio shows $0
- You need to add holdings first
- Click "Add Holding" button

### Can't login
- Check if you confirmed your email (Supabase sends confirmation)
- Try signing up with a different email

### Market data not loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Edge Function might need a moment to warm up
- Try refreshing the page

## What's NOT Working Yet
