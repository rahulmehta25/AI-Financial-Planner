## Success Criteria for Each Task
- ✅ Code works with REAL data (no hardcoding)
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No silent failures (proper error handling)
- ✅ Performance meets targets (<100ms for calculations)
- ✅ Security best practices followed
- ✅ Committed to git with meaningful message

## Current Priority: Tasks 1-4
Start by removing ALL fake code, then build the database foundation properly. No shortcuts, no mock data, no "we'll fix it later".

## Commit Guidelines
- Every task completion = one commit
- Commit message format: "type: description"
- Types: feat, fix, chore, test, docs
- Push after each successful task
- NO COMMITS until task is FULLY working

**Remember**: This is a financial application handling real money. There is no room for "toy" implementations or fake data. Every line of code must be production-quality from the start.
