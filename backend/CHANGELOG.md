## Migration Guide

### From Development to Demo Package
If you were using the development version:

1. **Update Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements_demo.txt`
2. **Database Migration**: Run `./reset_demo.sh` to initialize demo database
3. **Configuration**: Copy `env.template` to `.env` and configure as needed
4. **Start Demo**: Use `./start_demo.sh` instead of manual startup commands

## Known Issues

### Version 1.0.0
- **Simulation Memory**: Very large simulations (>100k scenarios) may require additional memory
- **Docker on M1 Macs**: Some performance degradation on Apple Silicon
- **Windows WSL**: File permissions may need adjustment for shell scripts
- **Firefox CORS**: Some CORS issues with Firefox in strict mode

### Workarounds
- **Memory Issues**: Reduce simulation count or increase system memory
- **M1 Performance**: Use native Python installation instead of Docker
