## 2025-08-27 - Market Data Integration Layer Implementation

**User Request**: Implement Market Data Integration Layer following Section 4 of the Technical Implementation Guide with multi-provider data aggregation, real-time WebSocket feeds, data caching, and data quality validation.

### Implementation Summary:

#### 1. Examined Existing Infrastructure
**Discovery**: Most components already existed with comprehensive implementations:

- **Market Data Aggregator** (`aggregator.py`): Sophisticated multi-provider system with circuit breakers, failover logic, and intelligent caching
- **Polygon.io Provider** (`providers/polygon_io.py`): Complete WebSocket implementation with real-time streaming, authentication, and error handling
- **Databento Provider** (`providers/databento.py`): Institutional-grade data provider with binary message handling (DBN format)
- **Yahoo Finance Provider** (`providers/yfinance_enhanced.py`): Robust fallback provider with thread pool execution
- **WebSocket Manager** (`websocket.py`): Multi-provider connection management with subscription handling
- **Enhanced Cache System** (`cache_enhanced.py`): Multi-tier caching with L1 memory, L2 Redis, quota management

#### 2. Created New Data Validator Component
**File**: `/backend/app/services/market_data/data_validator.py`

Implemented comprehensive data quality validation system:

**Key Features**:
- **Statistical Analysis**: IQR, Z-score, and modified Z-score outlier detection
- **Cross-Provider Validation**: Data consistency checks across multiple sources
- **OHLC Validation**: Price relationship consistency (Open ≤ High, Low ≤ Close, etc.)
- **Time-Series Continuity**: Gap detection and data integrity validation
- **Volume Analysis**: Trading volume outlier detection and validation
- **Market Hours Validation**: Trading session time verification
- **Price Movement Analysis**: Abnormal price change detection

**Core Classes**:
- `DataQualityValidator`: Main validation orchestrator
